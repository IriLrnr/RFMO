# RFMO

Fisheries often lie outside exclusive economic zones and have historically been unregulated and are overexploited. 
Regional Fishery Management Organisations (RFMOs) aim to coordinate the sustainable management of high seas stocks. 
Participating countries vote on harvesting efforts, with each RFMO requiring a specific level of agreement, ranging from majority to consensus. 

This code implements a multiplayer bioeconomic model to clarify how different voting thresholds affect conservation outcomes.
The simulation model simulates an iterative decision-making process where countries consider a proposed change to the total harvest,
either an incremental increase or decrease, and each country votes in favour of the change if it increases their personal utility.
In the semi-analytic section, we find solutions for the outcomes under different scenarios: no RFMO, and RFMOs after historical overexploitation or low exploitation.
